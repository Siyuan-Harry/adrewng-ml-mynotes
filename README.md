# adrewng-ml-mynotes

My detailed learning notes of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization (All three courses included). Around 60,000 words. I typed them word by word.

I faithfully recorded **every** detail of the course, plus some of my own understanding, clarification of concepts, etc., to form this note.

This may also be good for anyone interested in this course to study, or to review it. Please enjoy!
